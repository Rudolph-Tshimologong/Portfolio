                    The <em>Pontiac GTO</em> took the world by storm in 1964 and quickly cemented itself in muscle car history. As the GTO lasted five generations in total, it went through many different changes, responding to new challenges 
                    and attempting to give buyers an upgraded driving experience. Though relatively short-lived, 
                    the <strong>Pontiac GTO </strong>is still a favorite of many muscle car enthusiasts who love its striking style and roaring horsepower.

                    The <strong>Nissan 1400</strong> made its debut in South Africa in 1971. 
                    The original Datsun 1200 evolved into the Datsun 1400 in 1980 and became known as the Nissan 1400 in 1990. ... 
                    Small business owners and fleet operators continue to swear by the evergreen 1400 bakkie and are saddened by the news of its farewell.

                   <p>Mahabis is a game played between two teams. One team places their hand beneath a blanket and 
                       hide a ring in the palm of a teammate’s hand. Then they show their closed hands to the other
                        team. The other team have to guess in which hand the ring is hiding.
                        The ant and the elephant were very good friends indeed and would play together 
                        whenever they had the chance.
                        The trouble was, the elephant’s father was a very strict father and 
                        he did not like his son playing when there was homework to be done, or if his mother 
                        needed chores doing. And he did not like his son playing with his friend the ant when he 
                        should be playing with the other elephants in the pride.
                        The little elephant was very scared of his father and did not like it when he was angry. 
                        But the ant was a very brave ant and was not scared of the grumpy old father.One day, the two 
                        friends were playing a game of mahabis when they heard the angry father approaching. The ground 
                        shook violently and the trees swayed from side to side.‘Oh no, it's my father!’ cried the young 
                        elephant, a scared look upon his face. ‘What can I do?’
                        The little ant puffed out his chest and stood to his full height. ‘Don’t worry, my friend, you can 
                        hide behind me and your father will not find you!’

                        The trouble was, the elephant’s father was a very strict father and 
                        he did not like his son playing when there was homework to be done, or if his mother 
                        needed chores doing. And he did not like his son playing with his friend the ant when he 
                        should be playing with the other elephants in the pride.
                        The little elephant was very scared of his father and did not like it when he was angry. 
                        But the ant was a very brave ant and was not scared of the grumpy old father.One day, the two 
                        friends were playing a game of mahabis when they heard the angry father approaching. The ground 
                        shook violently and the trees swayed from side to side.‘Oh no, it's my father!’ cried the young 
                        elephant, a scared look upon his face. ‘What can I do?’
                        The little ant puffed out his chest and stood to his full height. ‘Don’t worry, my friend, you can 
                        hide behind me and your father will not find you!’
